Developer empathy
=================

**Design with developer empathy**

When it comes to APIs, developers are your users. The same principles of
user-centred design apply to the development and publication of APIs
(simplicity, obviousness, fit-for-purpose etc).  Most of the other criteria in
this guide are traceable to the principles of good design. Perhaps the most
important criteria to be mindful of is *simplicity*: as with any other product,
people simply won't use something if it is hard to use.

Hard-to-use APIs create bad public policy outcomes:
 * Potential significant social and economic value will remain undiscovered
   and unrealised
 * Secondary markets that rely on APIs (e.g. automated tax reporting software)
   will be smaller and less competitive, and therefor less able to create value
   for the Australian public (API complexity creates barriers to market entry)


.. recommended::

   An API that is consistently rated as hard to use should be improved.
   Ensure less than 20% of feedback rates the API as hard to use.
